## Overview

This session introduces attendees to Terraform as the de-facto standard for infrastructure as code. You will get hands-on experience with deploying and provisioning services and app subscriptions.

In this session we will walk you through the setup process of the SAP Build portfolio via the Terraform Provider for SAP BTP. At the end of the session, you will have the following assets in your SAP BTP trial account ready to use:

- SAP Build Code
- SAP Build Process Automation
